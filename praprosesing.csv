A: No.  For transmission, the data is encoded into the 64QAM signal and sent to all the beamformers where then the beam steering phase shift is added.

The IC chips that are soldered on the PCB boards which are intricately interconnected to the CPUs (central processing units), which direct all the command in machine language, and are being processed and stored into RAM (random access memory). There&#39;s also the ROM (read only memory) where the instructions are stored for execution processing. Imagine thousands of these Computers inside hundreds of these PCB (printed circuit boards) that are telling the other components to do their specific tasks in order for intricate parts of the Satellite Dish to function without errors. Hundreds or thousands of these Satellites orbiting the Earth while communicating with the Starlink Dish installed on top of the roof or any platform simultaneously is amazing.

And here is the second time he came with the breach, but he and those with him, add to them Elon Musk, who bought many votes from Arabs and Muslims, most of whom belong to terrorism and support it. So the fire breaks out, and God Almighty made them forget His power and ability, and that He does what He wills, so God made His storms rage with the fire, carrying its flames and its stormy winds blowing throughout the regions, eating the green before eating the dry grass. Believe me, I do not want anything from you. All I wanted was for you to return to your lands, and do not let it be easy for you, so you leave them to those who covet it. Hold on to your land, for the land will remain, and we will all go until God wills. Hold on to your lands. Rebuild your homes with your own hands and do not allow them to control them because if they own your lands, they will build what they planned and the price per square meter will increase at least tenfold. Therefore, O people of Los Angeles, California, return to your land no matter what it costs you and build your homes, for God will show you their reality and you will see that my words are not inspired or imaginary. Take this small proof: What is the benefit of Elon Musk, who cared about Trump&#39;s campaign and funded Trump&#39;s campaign with an amount of one billion and six hundred million dollars üíµ if he did not have a benefit to compensate for funding Trump&#39;s campaign with this amount? Knowing that we are all Muslims and Christians, if we pray, before or after prayer or in the middle of prayer we ask God for forgiveness? You coveted the Arab countries and the Arabs, you coveted the Islamic countries and the Muslims, and today your coveting has extended to your people. You forgot who is the living God who does not die and in whose hand is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and He is the One who subjected to Solomon, peace be upon him, a kingdom that no one after him should have. So God made you forget His power and might, until when He wanted to reveal their true nature to the people in general and to your people in particular, He sent upon you His storms that swept away what your hands stained with all kinds of falsehood had ignited, O criminals. Satan fled from you, seeking refuge in God through the evil of your actions. The American Senate and Republican Party, add to them Trump, who is the mirror through which they see how they will agree to displace the people of America in the state of Los Angeles, California, which is one of the states famous for its wealth and the wealth of its good lands, especially the beauty of its beaches that sparkle with the colors of diamonds when the rays of the sun shine on them. So God willed that your plan would fail and make you a lesson. To the world, the fires spread from one region to another through the storms that carried the flames and flew with them, burning the green before burning all the grass from the dry land. Oh people of Los Angeles, California, hold on to your land and do not leave it exposed to the traitors of the filthy people, the first of whom are the American Senate and Republican Party and Trump and Elon Musk, who covet your land, property and money. If your land is lost, then you are the losers and you are the ones who will make them richer than they are. This is the era of greed for people and what they are bored with. I did not ask you for a service and I did not want anything from you except for you to wake up, for God‚Äôs sake, and here I am, jealous of you as I am jealous of all the good people. I only warn you .<br>By God, there is no god but Him, God alone, without partner. They are deceiving you, so wake up and hold on to your land.

TV Satelites are technicly signal repeaters, thats why it was easy to broudcast digital tv (DVB-S)  even thru they didnt been designed for it and its not effecint way to do so",tv satelitt also import say geo stationri orbit orbit rel earth rotat perspect earth us dont move sky dont need safist mechan reciv signal also incorrect send signal option mention tv signal need send tv satelit technicli signal repeat that easi broudcast digit tv dvb even thru didnt design effecint way

When we think, neurons fire to produce oscillating electrical voltages that represent different types of thoughts and thought patterns. In this way neurons communicate with each other to produce movement throughout the body. Just the same as in modulation where a carrier wave is encoded with information by varying the electrical voltage to represent different types of data. Nerves act like wires carrying electrical currents that flow through the nervous system thus creating the magnetic and electric field that emanates from the body. It is my theory that as these voltages in the brain oscillate it creates a changing magnetic and electric field which produces electromagnetic wave propagation carrying information about our thoughts and feelings that can then be reproduced in the wave patterns of other people through electromagnetic induction thus enabling brain to brain communication or telepathy.",amaz correl function nervou system telecommun think neuron fire produc oscil electr voltag repres differ type thought thought pattern way neuron commun produc movement throughout bodi modul carrier wave encod inform vari electr voltag repres differ type data nerv act like wire carri electr current flow nervou system thu creat magnet electr field eman bodi theori voltag brain oscil creat chang magnet electr field produc electromagnet wave propag carri inform thought feel reproduc wave pattern peopl electromagnet induct thu enabl brain brain commun telepathi

While the signals fall within the safety limits set by regulatory bodies, some critics worry about long-term exposure to low-level RF radiation, especially in densely populated areas or for users with continuous exposure. However, more research is needed to fully understand any potential health impacts.

The consistent style you settled on is good and the libraries of assets more and more useful every show you make. Using that paradigm is quite literally the only way this series can be economical. 3D animation takes a LOT of time and any way you can scrape efficiency into a workflow, the less arduous it is for everyone involved.

2024-07-01 00:28:13,@davidlisowski4179,"Very interesting video as I was not aware of Starlink&#39;s operating characteristics. I assumed OFDM as in orthogonal frequency division. The 64 QAM modulation provides 6 bits per frequency per symbol period, which is not bad for communicating 500 miles away, and also with all the other effects that must be factored in like doppler and the need for channel frequency correction. In cell phones and WiFi we now in 5G/6G go up to 1024 and even 4096 instead of 64 QAM, more bits per symbol but they only have to transit a few kilometers or a few feet in the case of WiFI.  The finer the constellation the grid the more you need a good channel condition. The error vector magnitude which is the noise component must be small or errors come into play.  One additional thing that could be mentioned is there is a need for reference signals, which along with the data symbol have a known amplitude ( 1 ), and a determined phase. When detected the reference signal allows us to rotate the  signal received and scale them to get a good grid on which we can detect what the value transmitted is. Another thing not mentioned is forward error correction. We add many more bits to the transmitted signal and are able to figure out which bits were not received correctly and correct them. I am sure there are control channels, probably a random access channel to gain the satellites attention. Great video, keep them coming.",interest video awar starlink oper characterist assum ofdm orthogon frequenc divis qam modul provid bit per frequenc per symbol period bad commun mile away also effect must factor like doppler need channel frequenc correct cell phone wifi gg go even instead qam bit per symbol transit kilomet feet case wifi finer constel grid need good channel condit error vector magnitud nois compon must small error come play one addit thing could mention need refer signal along data symbol known amplitud determin phase detect refer signal allow us rotat signal receiv scale get good grid detect valu transmit anoth thing mention forward error correct add mani bit transmit signal abl figur bit receiv correctli correct sure control channel probabl random access channel gain satellit attent great video keep come

Although there are more than one Dishy on the ground the Satellite has to aim a beam simultaneously at many Dishys...  And the other thing not covered in this video, when one satellite goes out of site, Dishy has to switch to another satellite to keep the internet connection up and running. So this re-aiming the beam must be done very quickly... Unbelievable this all, but it works.<br>I juist thought of another question. The satelliet communicates with a groundstation. However it will be in radio contact also only for about 2 minutes, so do the Starlink satellites communicatie amongst each other to relay the internet link?

So are u blessed with all this knowledge without contributing to the real world or u just want to spread this knowledge generously and let people take their course in it and whoever have that power money can do something about it later. There&#39;s no one in entire world who can make use of this wide range of knowledge without some restraint from the people itself or the government.

It&#39;s not the satellite it&#39;s the number of satelites in low earth orbit travelling at  27000km per hour. Starlinks&#39; goal is something like 45k satelites with a life expectancy of 4 years. So constant replacements will need to be launched. This will make it almost impossible to escape earth without crashing into a starlink satelite. Critical thinking is not cynicism.,see ironi guy want go mar respons launch space imposs satellit number satelit low earth orbit travel km per hour starlink goal someth like k satelit life expect year constant replac need launch make almost imposs escap earth without crash starlink satelit critic think cynic

BUT, if you work online, game, watch movies, etc., ditch the other satellite providers and get StarLink, you will not regret it!  <br><br>Oh, the install was a bit rough, but that was because of our roof and it being higher than I can get to.

Because for the real-time, high-speed signal processing required for beamforming and tracking satellites the CPU is not suitable at all. So CPU should manage network functions, user interaction, and system controls.  So what i guess is that the chip you mention that calculates the phase angles for the beamformers, part of a digital signal processing (DSP) system, is fact either an fpga or an ASIC and doesnt run therefore any software, because is already configured in hw.",superb job congrat would say user termin cpu need fpgaor even asic display video realtim highspe signal process requir beamform track satellit cpu suitabl cpu manag network function user interact system control guess chip mention calcul phase angl beamform part digit signal process dsp system fact either fpga asic doesnt run therefor softwar alreadi configur hw

2024-01-29 20:28:35,@0abj0123,"I am a former engineer who designed mobile phones in Japan. The same passive phased array antenna is used in the AWS SPY-1 radar of the Aegis warship owned by countries such as the United States and Japan. Recently, flat antennas have also been sold for terrestrial television reception.
<br>Digital transmission technologies include binary BPSK, 4-value QPSK, and 64QAM, which adds not only phase but also amplitude, and 256QAM for terrestrial Wi-FI and 5G communications, but if communication conditions are poor, 64QAM is used. It will fall. Maybe 64QAM is the most practical with current technology?
<br>By the way, there is one thing that bothers me. This is a very detailed question, but why are broadcasting and communication satellites orbiting 36,000 km above the equator flying in the opposite direction to the Earth&#39;s rotation? It cannot be a geostationary satellite unless it rotates in the same direction and at the same speed as the Earth&#39;s rotation.

(they called me &#39;Brainwave&#39;)  Later on I built many more electronic projects first with tubes and later with transistors.  I grew up on a farm and was destined to be a farmer but my interest in electronics eventually led me to a career in mainframe computers starting in 1965.  And of course, I built my first personal computer from a magazine article around 1975.  Over the years I have gained a very good understanding of how radio and TV work, and the learned about computers from the ground up as I started my career as a field technician - installing and maintaining mainframe computers.  So my understanding and knowledge of electronic technology now also included the digital realm.  I am now 83 years old and many years retired and no longer in touch with the latest and greatest.

They should circle the earth in a geosynchronous manner, i.e., the angular rotation speed of the satellite is exactly the same as the earth rotation so that at any point on earth, we can find the geostationary satellite at a fixed angle.

What type of fuel does a satellite use????? What kind of propulsion system does a satellite use to navigate space??? If you can see space craft fly over the surface of the moon with a telescope, why can&#39;t you see a so-called satellite flying a quarter of the distance away.????

To own one was owning the Cadillac of the industry.  The quality and amount of channels was considered way better than cable.  Star Link and how it works is blowing my mind.  Having it continually changing between moving satellites without even a blip in signal or having to move and recalibrate is amazing.  In the last 10 years I was a consultant traveling all over the US and I would sit on the plane wondering how that flat disk less than 3 feet in diameter on top of the place is picking up a signal so good when where I lived an 8 foot stationary dish was marginal. I know digital signals helped. Towards the end of my business I was selling Dish Network and Direct TV but to track on a moving vehicle going 500 MPH blew my mind.  Now it is completely mind boggling.  You explanation is great.  It is so captivating.  You go into just enough detail.

Another provider Cable and Wireless has released some other packages whilst faster and call it unlimited lite or unlimited ......, it&#39;s really not, they give up to 30GB per day for the more expensive package, and around 20GB per day for  cheapest plus any unused data is none transferable to the next day, it&#39;s a rip off and if we give it several years and evolution in technology working with internet such as gaming these data caps would be largely  insufficient, I have enough of those BS and patiently waiting for Starlink operations to commence in Seychelles, I believe the speeds would be way way better than our providers local offerings.",hi thank video starlink trueli amaz technolog seychel live internet like luxuri provid whilst promot internet tend lie peopl face lot peopl quit gullibl simpli may understand biggest problem internet speed pain slow sever provid offer faster speed peopl sign cap internet packag good book anoth provid cabl wireless releas packag whilst faster call unlimit lite unlimit realli give gb per day expens packag around gb per day cheapest plu unus data none transfer next day rip give sever year evolut technolog work internet game data cap would larg insuffici enough bs patient wait starlink oper commenc seychel believ speed would way way better provid local offer

Now, we only get interruptions in service for a few seconds each month. I even get service during stormy weather with only a few exceptions for a few seconds every year now. So I am 100% satisfied with service and you can even travel with a satellite on your RV or boat.

2023-01-04 17:12:57,@georgespix7125,"Goodman natural disasters of all kinds including human. We desperately need an emergency communication system. I would like to see a network infrastructure. Which used the existing level to commercial channel, part of the GPS specification, riding over the top of it with a non-interfering coding. A very low bandwidth. But data channel. That could be received by every handset built in the last decade. As they currently process the L2C channel. For some additional reach, tuning the satellite, but information wise it&#39;s largely unused. So the correct coding cannot interfere. Take this broadcast signal that for standards reasons and interoperability reasons among 10 decades of cell phones built. Will all receive the same broadcast channel. So every handset around the world will receive it. Consider that every cell phone tower. Is booming out its signal at a strength That is strong enough to reach low earth orbit plus much more. So as every starlink satellite passes through the cell tower transmission. It takes the text messages and drops them into the L2C channel. That every handset will receive, drop it into a circular buffer, and when unique, pass it up the text message stack. We&#39;re all current social applications, for legacy reasons still support their initial transport of text messages. So that&#39;s the downlink outbound channel. And the uplink is any handset that sends a text message. Because that too will be likely with some probability to be received by one of the circling starlinks. And And then down linked broadcast using the L2C, where consider this a basketball team, where you want every player to touch the ball at least once. And once the player sees his own text again. It knows that it&#39;s been reliably received everywhere. Latency is terrible, bandwidth is miserable. But it&#39;s measurable and durable and anti-fragile. And all from to addresses are unique, as assigned and ranges by the ITU. So attribution of the sender is guaranteed. Which makes this effectively a parallel party line in text messages to every handset around the world. Where in every handset the social applications work using compatible, for legacy purposes  text message service, making every handset its own server for all of its applications that are text-based. Think Twitter and Facebook. Where are the handset can retain a month or a year&#39;s worth of text messages, even more if <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23selected"">#selected</a>. Which devolves to a series of from phone numbers to filter. So given every handset is its own server for every application that can run on only text messages. In the clear or not. But if not there&#39;s a horrendous key management problem, and legacy compatibility issues. Wherefore most social networks, privacy can&#39;t be guaranteed about the best you can do is integrity. Which is more than enough for human to human communication. And there&#39;s just not that much texting in terms of bandwidth needed, or number of messages per evond around the world. Gigabytes, not terabytes of  weeks if not months of text messages. Where in actual use only post of the last month are of any utility. And if you really want a database search or a large content. You can go find a high bandwidth network. But in the interim you fall back to the old equivalent of telexes. Which the world used to run on without any problem. Certainly enough to manage any transaction related function.

2022-11-19 12:29:56,@GEOsustainable,"Antenna engineering is a whole &#39;nother field of electrical engineering. At Purdue, I looked at the math and said I am not worthy. Then ending up needing it my whole career, LOL.<br>Years later I met the fellow that invented the phased locked loop used here in places. We used to swap books; that was like as good as it got back then for entertainment. The TV screen was inside our head. He read about 5 to my one. Anyway, he worked on the radar used in the bomber in WW2. The PLL is why we were so accurate. Back in the day, every &#39;good&#39; radio had a circuit called &#39;selectivity and sensitivity&#39; whose function was to be sensitive to certain frequency and less sensitive to all others. That allowed you to &#39;tune in&#39; to a station. Back then, everything also started by making a crystal vibrate ( interacting with a physical object and colliding it with a physical reaction from a separate source) Same thing here. I am reminded and thrilled to see the same physics applied in new ways and that there is nothing new under the sun. Today, crystals are &#39;grown&#39;, back then they were actually hand cut. And because, they were sold in &#39;sizes&#39;. That mattered because it took power to tune. less vibration meant you needed more power to move it.<br>The brilliance are they use man&#39;s combined knowledge to do some incredible. Again, bravo Elon.",antenna engin whole nother field electr engin purdu look math said worthi end need whole career lolyear later met fellow invent phase lock loop use place use swap book like good got back entertain tv screen insid head read one anyway work radar use bomber ww pll accur back day everi good radio circuit call select sensit whose function sensit certain frequenc less sensit other allow tune station back everyth also start make crystal vibrat interact physic object collid physic reaction separ sourc thing remind thrill see physic appli new way noth new sun today crystal grown back actual hand cut sold size matter took power tune less vibrat meant need power move itth brillianc use man combin knowledg incred bravo elon

2022-11-18 22:20:46,@NIGHTOWL-jf9zt,"Totally understandable, just like: <br><br>The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn&#39;t. By subtracting where it is from where it isn&#39;t, or where it isn&#39;t from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or a deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn&#39;t, and arriving at a position where it wasn&#39;t, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn&#39;t, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn&#39;t.<br>
<br>In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn&#39;t, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn&#39;t. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.
<br>
<br>The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn&#39;t, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn&#39;t, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn&#39;t be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.",total understand like missil know time know know isnt subtract isnt isnt whichev greater obtain differ deviat guidanc subsystem use deviat gener correct command drive missil posit posit isnt arriv posit wasnt consequ posit posit wasnt follow posit posit isnt event posit posit wasnt system acquir variat variat differ missil wasnt variat consid signific factor may correct gea howev missil must also know missil guidanc comput scenario work follow variat modifi inform missil obtain sure howev sure isnt within reason know subtract wasnt viceversa differenti algebra sum shouldnt abl obtain deviat variat call error

The most convincing version of the story I read at the time was that a misfeature of Aegis was the largest single component of the debacle. <br><br>This is a long while back, but as I recall the story, this was one of the first naval radar systems which automatically linked multiple ships into a combined combat map, when possible. The design problem: before the ships link up, they separately assign numbers to each blip. After they link up, consistent numbers are assigned across the combined map. This forces some blips to suddenly change their assigned number, as perceived by the person at the console on one ship or another. I guess there was supposed to be a way to make the operator aware of these reassignment events, but in this instance it appears that the operator managed to read some parameters from before the number change and some numbers from a different blip after the number change, thinking this was all one aircraft, with the net effect being that a commercial flight that should have been going up was seen as going down, on an apparent attack profile. In addition, they had incorrect information on board about scheduled commercial flights, and a few other factors (as always) that complicated matters, one of which I think involved use of incorrect radio frequencies to contact the aircraft. <br><br>In any case, this particular theory behind the accident drew on incredibly detailed internals of Aegis and the phased array radar system, so everything here was already familiar to me, except for the extreme miniaturization, which is nevertheless mind blowing.",abl follow along fine first pass iran air flight shootdown uss vincenn aftermath huge featur articl technic public concern anspi phase array radar system aegi combat system control convinc version stori read time misfeatur aegi largest singl compon debacl long back recal stori one first naval radar system automat link multipl ship combin combat map possibl design problem ship link separ assign number blip link consist number assign across combin map forc blip suddenli chang assign number perceiv person consol one ship anoth guess suppos way make oper awar reassign event instanc appear oper manag read paramet number chang number differ blip number chang think one aircraft net effect commerci flight go seen go appar attack profil addit incorrect inform board schedul commerci flight factor alway complic matter one think involv use incorrect radio frequenc contact aircraft case particular theori behind accid drew incred detail intern aegi phase array radar system everyth alreadi familiar except extrem miniatur nevertheless mind blow

2022-09-10 03:55:36,@rebel.8830,"please read this carefully and to the end ;<br><br>Every one of us has sinned against God. We‚Äôve lied, we‚Äôve stolen, we‚Äôve sinned sexually, and we‚Äôve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never ‚Äòoutweigh‚Äô our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he sent his son, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said ‚Äòit is finished‚Äô .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God‚Äôs judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn‚Äôt even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You‚Äôve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn‚Äôt guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ; <br><br>‚ÄòIt is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT‚Äô<br><br>GOD BLESS ANYONE WHO READS THIS.

We all know there is a lot of radiation in space.  Could this technology be used to collect the radiation electrons and channel and concentrate the electron flow it to provide propulsion electrons for a space craft?  This might solve a few problems, the collection process would lower, if not eliminate radiation in the direction of travel, depending upon the velocity of the craft and the concentrated exit of electrons would move the craft.  Another benefit of the system would be that the abundance of fuel would be virtually in exhaustible and would not be needed storage space on the vehicle.  I am about as smart as a mud fence in a monsoon rain, I am assuming that this has already been thought of by people much smarter than me.  While I have many more thoughts on this, I will stop inconveniencing electrons, which could be used for other purposes, and close.  Thank you for your time.

It is feasible to have NEARLY 1.5Gbs at 2 TO 5ms latency if you used two Dishys with one in receive mode ONLY and one in NORMAL MODE if I am understanding this correctly. The reason for possible increased latency is since each dishy has about a 100 degree field of view, you could potentially have the two dishys pointed in different directions about 720 meters apart, using cat6 or better to a central location and have a much wider coverage, especially if at the peak of a mountain with one dishy not physically being able to &quot;see&quot; the other. This would provide, while both are operating, much faster speeds in both uplink and downlink, and if one goes down, while link speeds will slow, it will not die entirely.<br>A few questions:<br>1. How many sats are currently in orbit and what is the number per year on the planning board to put the required amount in orbit for continuous coverage with a few hundred extra thrown in for redundancy?<br>2.  Will the cost come down as more sats go up?<br>3. What is the reason for NOT using geostationary sats? Seems that if the sats were geostationary, then the beam steering would not really be needed and used only to fine tune the signal strength!<br>Thank you for an outstanding video.

Typically QAM is reserved for terestrial lines like coax which is 256 QAM. The signal to space is usually too dirty but the low orbit makes it possible. Typical SATCOM to geostationary satellites run QPSK or 8PSK.,congrat excel minim error ive work satcom year went straight x video fanstat love cover qam typic qam reserv terestri line like coax qam signal space usual dirti low orbit make possibl typic satcom geostationari satellit run qpsk psk

Even Elon Musk stated that Starlink was aimed at mainly these rural and remote users that have little or limited internet accessibility.  In the cities you can bet it&#39;s only the government and financial institutions that will access the satellites while the rest of us get by on fibre optic or landline based communications for internet.,unfortun due limit bandwidth limit number user user cell access satellit one time fine rural remot region low popul larger urban region even elon musk state starlink aim mainli rural remot user littl limit internet access citi bet govern financi institut access satellit rest us get fibr optic landlin base commun internet

The other part, 2, could be how that 10000+ Starlink Satellites communicate with each other, when it reach to this number. I heard that, in the future, they will be able to receive data from the initial Dishy, talk to each other over the space till the destination and head back in the same way to the initial Dishy, making the fastest communication ever. For instance, from America to Asia, the initial Dishy in Earth sends data to Satellite in Space that sends data to another Dishy in the Earth that sends it again to another Satellite in space till it reaches Asia and heads back to the initial Dishy in America using the same process. It could face Death interferences. But with Starlink Satellites talking to each other, the data leaves the initial Dishy in America,reaches the first Satellite that sends it to another Satellite, traveling on just only in space, till it gets to Asia.

I know a few people here in NZ with Starlink, and it absolutely rocks for our relatively tiny rural population. One friend had his zero-techie wife unbox and set it up, and within 5 mins they had 250 Mbps. And even the US military were gobsmacked by how SpaceX managed to drop in 000&#39;s of terminals into the Ukraine military 2-3 days after the war broke out, and completely neutralise Russian&#39;s prior mega attack on the Ukrainians&#39; Viasat satellite military comms system. The Ukraine military now have the world&#39;s best integrated comms system for weapons targeting and control, and Starlink is one of the key reasons (along with Ukrainian tech brilliance). The Russians also tried to radio-jam the Starlink terminals, but Starlink downloaded a patch to all terminals immediately to stop this jamming in its tracks. Starlink is now Ukraine&#39;s military backbone as well as providing wifi internet to 100,000+ Ukrainians in areas where the Russians have destroyed the mobile infrastructure.

2022-08-21 00:01:29,@TheTonyMcD,"Honestly, I&#39;m more interested in how the Starlink satellites communicate with a central network. I would assume that all of them are in visual range of at least one other at all times. I assume that they transmit the signals through each other until it reaches one that is over a ground station. But I&#39;d love to learn exactly how that process works. How much additional latency does that add to the signal? How many ground stations are there?<br><br>I&#39;d also be interested in how the Starlink satellite itself is able to communicate with multiple dishes. If one is over say New York, or some densely populated area, how does that affect its bandwidth for each individual receiver? In this video, you said that it has two uplink and two downlink dishes, so how would it manage to communicate with multiple users with only two downlinks? Initilly I thought it would utilize a time share like process. But that would essentially mean each users bandwidth is halved for each additional user connected to that same satellite, which seems infeasible. Most wireless networks would dedicate a certain number of channels at slightly different frequencies, but is this even possible for Starlink? Does it need to direct its beam like the ground base dishes have to? That would seem to make channels effectively useless. Or, does it have a stronger more complex method of transmitting signals that does not require the beam to be directed?",honestli im interest starlink satellit commun central network would assum visual rang least one time assum transmit signal reach one ground station id love learn exactli process work much addit latenc add signal mani ground station thereid also interest starlink satellit abl commun multipl dish one say new york dens popul area affect bandwidth individu receiv video said two uplink two downlink dish would manag commun multipl user two downlink initilli thought would util time share like process would essenti mean user bandwidth halv addit user connect satellit seem infeas wireless network would dedic certain number channel slightli differ frequenc even possibl starlink need direct beam like ground base dish would seem make channel effect useless stronger complex method transmit signal requir beam direct

2022-08-19 15:45:49,@------country-boy-------,Wow guys that is amazing.  I would have designed the system a lot different though.  I would have used green/blue lasers and a telescopic lense system with stepper motor tracking.  Might need 2 telescopes however so one could be transceiving while the other re-aligning / waiting for next sequential satilite orbit.  Not sure if lasers could penetrate cloud and rain - maybe that&#39;s why starlink uses high frequency radio transmission.,wow guy amaz would design system lot differ though would use greenblu laser telescop lens system stepper motor track might need telescop howev one could transceiv realign wait next sequenti satilit orbit sure laser could penetr cloud rain mayb that starlink use high frequenc radio transmiss

This is important because it explains why TV dishes can point at a single point in the sky, while Starlink beams need to be electronically steered. Furthermore, while the earth is correctly shown as rotating counterclockwise from the north pole, both satellites are orbiting in the wrong direction, east to west, while nearly all satellites orbit west to east to take advantage of earth&#39;s velocity.<br><br>Overall though, very nice video that explains complex electronic and communications concepts.",small nitpick orbit anim tv satellit shown geostationari orbit area earth rotat import explain tv dish point singl point sky starlink beam need electron steer furthermor earth correctli shown rotat counterclockwis north pole satellit orbit wrong direct east west nearli satellit orbit west east take advantag earth velocityoveral though nice video explain complex electron commun concept
